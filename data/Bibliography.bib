  abstract = {We present a new data set of attributes for 671 catchments in the contiguous United States (CONUS) minimally impacted by human activities. This complements the daily time series of meteorological forcing and streamflow provided by Newman et al. (2015b). To produce this extension, we synthesized diverse and complementary data sets to describe six main classes of attributes at the catchment scale: topography, climate, streamflow, land cover, soil, and geology. The spatial variations among basins over the CONUS are discussed and compared using a series of maps. The large number of catchments, combined with the diversity of the attributes we extracted, makes this new data set well suited for large-sample studies and comparative hydrology. In comparison to the similar Model Parameter Estimation Experiment (MOPEX) data set, this data set relies on more recent data, it covers a wider range of attributes, and its catchments are more evenly distributed across the CONUS. This study also involves assessments of the limitations of the source data sets used to compute catchment attributes, as well as detailed descriptions of how the attributes were computed. The hydrometeorological time series provided by Newman et al. (2015b, https://doi.org/10.5065/D6MW2F4D) together with the catchment attributes introduced in this paper (https://doi.org/10.5065/D6G73C3Q) constitute the freely available CAMELS data set, which stands for Catchment Attributes and MEteorology for Large-sample Studies.},

While there is a wealth of guidance on scenariobased climate adaptation planning, this guidance typically assumes the selection and use of decadal to century-long time segments of downscaled climate model projections, rather than the creation of a customized scenario depicting a specific extreme event. We address this gap by synthesizing a variety of data sources and analytical techniques for constructing climate scenarios for stress tests that are customized to address specific end-users' needs. We then illustrate the development and application of climate scenarios with a case study that explores water sustainability under changing climate in the Truckee and Carson River basins of California and Nevada. Finally, we assess the potential advantages and disadvantages of the different data sources and analytical techniques described to provide guidance on which are best suited for an intended application based on the system of study, the stakeholders involved, and the resources available. Ultimately, this work is intended to provide the building blocks with which scientist-stakeholder teams can produce their own stress test scenarios to explore place-based weather and climate risks.},

However, there are still uncertainties associated with rainfall products performance used to estimate hydrologic signatures in several regions, such as Brazil. Here, we investigate the performance of three rainfall products in estimating daily precipitation, daily river discharge, and hydrologic signatures over Brazil: the SM2RAIN-ASCAT and the GPM+SM2RAIN satellite products, and the ERA5 reanalysis product. We used a subset of 520 catchments from the Catchments Attributes for Brazil (CABra) dataset and the hydrologic modeling was carried out using the MISDc hydrologic model. Satellite-based products performed better than ERA5 for most Brazilian biomes in estimating daily precipitation when compared with ground observations used as reference. Daily river discharge was also better modeled with SM2RAIN-ASCAT and GPM+SM2RAIN. Hydrologic modeling presented low values of bias and {$>$}80\% of catchments with KGE {$>$} 0.5 in calibration. Lastly, hydrologic signatures were well estimated by SM2RAIN-ASCAT and GPM+SM2RAIN, and for some biomes (Atlantic Forest, Cerrado, and Caatinga) they are better predictors than ground-based observations. We showed that there is a significant added value when using SM2RAIN-ASCAT and GPM+SM2RAIN products in tropical catchments, allowing a high-quality continuous water resources monitoring even in data-scarce regions. Besides, our findings pave the way for a better understanding of hydrologic extremes (droughts and floods) using these satellite rainfall products on multiple spatial and temporal scales.},

The issue is tackled herein by generating a large number of representative climate projections using weather generators calibrated with the outputs of regional climate models. A case study was performed on the South Nation River Watershed located in Eastern Ontario, Canada, using climate projections generated by four climate models and forced with medium- to high-emission scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) for the future 30-year period (2071{\textendash}2100). These raw projections were corrected using two downscaling techniques. Large ensembles of future series were created by perturbing downscaled data with a stochastic weather generator, then used as inputs to a hydrological model that was calibrated using observed data. Risk indices calculated with the simulated streamflow data were converted into probability distributions using Kernel Density Estimations. The results are dimensional joint probability distributions of risk-relevant indices that provide estimates of the likelihood of unwanted events under a given watershed configuration and management policy. The proposed approach offers a more complete vision of the impacts of climate change and opens the door to a more objective assessment of adaptation strategies.},

  abstract = {Abstract. We introduce the first catchment dataset for large sample studies in Chile. This dataset includes 516~catchments; it covers particularly wide latitude (17.8~to 55.0{$\circ$}\,S) and elevation (0~to 6993\,m\,a.s.l.) ranges, and it relies on multiple data sources (including ground data, remote-sensed products and reanalyses) to characterise the hydroclimatic conditions and landscape of a region where in situ measurements are scarce. For each catchment, the dataset provides boundaries, daily streamflow records and basin-averaged daily time series of precipitation (from one national and three global datasets), maximum, minimum and mean temperatures, potential evapotranspiration (PET; from two datasets), and snow water equivalent. We calculated hydro-climatological indices using these time series, and leveraged diverse data sources to extract topographic, geological and land cover features. Relying on publicly available reservoirs and water rights data for the country, we estimated the degree of anthropic intervention within the catchments. To facilitate the use of this dataset and promote common standards in large sample studies, we computed most catchment attributes introduced by Addor et al.~(2017) in their Catchment Attributes and MEteorology for Large-sample Studies~(CAMELS) dataset, and added several others. We used the dataset presented here (named CAMELS-CL) to characterise regional variations in hydroclimatic conditions over Chile and to explore how basin behaviour is influenced by catchment attributes and water extractions. Further, CAMELS-CL enabled us to analyse biases and uncertainties in basin-wide precipitation and PET. The characterisation of catchment water balances revealed large discrepancies between precipitation products in arid regions and a systematic precipitation underestimation in headwater mountain catchments (high elevations and steep slopes) over humid regions. We evaluated PET products based on ground data and found a fairly good performance of both products in humid regions (r{$>$}0.91) and lower correlation (r{$<$}0.76) in hyper-arid regions. Further, the satellite-based PET showed a consistent overestimation of observation-based PET. Finally, we explored local anomalies in catchment response by analysing the relationship between hydrological signatures and an attribute characterising the level of anthropic interventions. We showed that larger anthropic interventions are correlated with lower than normal annual flows, runoff ratios, elasticity of runoff with respect to precipitation, and flashiness of runoff, especially in arid catchments. CAMELS-CL provides unprecedented information on catchments in a region largely underrepresented in large sample studies. This effort is part of an international initiative to create multi-national large sample datasets freely available for the community. CAMELS-CL can be visualised from http://camels.cr2.cl and downloaded from https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.894885.},

However, these arbitrary windows may not encompass the strongest periods of climatic sensitivity and may lead to erroneous biological interpretations. Therefore, there is a need to consider a wider range of climate windows to better predict the impacts of future climate change. We introduce the R package climwin that provides a number of methods to test the effect of different climate windows on a chosen response variable and compare these windows to identify potential climate signals. climwin extracts the relevant data for each possible climate window and uses this data to fit a statistical model, the structure of which is chosen by the user. Models are then compared using an information criteria approach. This allows users to determine how well each window explains variation in the response variable and compare model support between windows. climwin also contains methods to detect type I and II errors, which are often a problem with this type of exploratory analysis. This article presents the statistical framework and technical details behind the climwin package and demonstrates the applicability of the method with a number of worked examples.},

While various perceptual models for experimental catchments have been developed, the concept is not widely used in defining or evaluating catchment models. This is, at least in part, because of the evident complexity possible in a perceptual model and the approximate nature of procedural model structures and parameterizations, particularly where there is a requirement for parameter parsimony. A perceptual model for catchments in Cumbria, North-West England, is developed as an exemplar and illustrated in terms of time varying distribution functions. Two critical questions are addressed: how can perceptual model hypotheses be tested at scales of interest, and how can constraints then be imposed on the basis of qualitative perceptual knowledge in conditioning predictive models? It is suggested that there is value in perceptual information, particularly in thinking about predicting the impacts of future change and that we still have much to learn about moving from observational and perceptual complexity to parsimonious predictability.},

  abstract = {Drought is among the costliest natural disasters that affect the economy, food and water security, and socioeconomic well-being of about 1.4 billion people in India. Despite the profound implications of droughts, the propagation of meteorological to hydrological droughts in India is not examined. Here, we use observations and simulations from a well-calibrated and evaluated Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model to estimate drought propagation in India. Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Standardized Soil Moisture Index (SSMI), and Standardized Streamflow Index (SSI) were estimated for 223 catchments in India to represent meteorological, agricultural, and hydrological droughts, respectively. We estimated drought propagation time for these catchments located in 18 major Indian subcontinental river basins. Internal propagation of hydrological drought was estimated using optimal hydrological Instantaneous Development Speed (IDS) and Instantaneous Recovery Speed (IRS) from onset to the termination. Indus, Sabarmati, and Godavari river basins have higher propagation time of meteorological to hydrological droughts. The high (low) development rate of hydrological drought is followed by the high (low) recovery rate for most of the locations. We find significant influence of Seasonality Index (SI) and Base Flow Index (BFI) on propagation time of meteorological to hydrological droughts in the Indian subcontinental river basins. Overall, understanding of drought propagation, development/recovery speed, and their deriving factors can assist in the management and planning of water resources in India.},

  abstract = {Understanding the spatiotemporal distribution of future droughts is essential for effective water resource management, especially in the Mediterranean region where water resources are expected to be scarcer in the future. In this study, we combined meteorological and hydrological drought indices with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to predict future dry years during two periods (2035{\textendash}2050and 2085{\textendash}2100) in a typical Mediterranean watershed in Northern Morocco, namely, Bouregreg watershed. The developed methodology was then used to evaluate drought impact on annual water yields and to identify the most vulnerable sub-basins within the study watershed. Two emission scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) of a downscaled global circulation model were used to force the calibrated SWAT model. Results indicated that Bouregreg watershed will experience several dry years with higher frequency especially at the end of current century. Significant decreases of annual water yields were simulated during dry years, ranging from -45.6\% to -76.7\% under RCP4.5, and from -66.7\% to -95.6\% under RCP8.5, compared to baseline. Overall, hydrologic systems in sub-basins under the ocean or high-altitude influence appear to be more resilient to drought. The combination of drought indices and the semi-distributed model offer a comprehensive tool to understand potential future droughts in Bouregreg watershed.},

  abstract = {We introduce a new catchment dataset for large-sample hydrological studies in Brazil. This dataset encompasses daily time series of observed streamflow from 3679 gauges, as well as meteorological forcing (precipitation, evapotranspiration, and temperature) for 897 selected catchments. It also includes 65 attributes covering a range of topographic, climatic, hydrologic, land cover, geologic, soil, and human intervention variables, as well as data quality indicators. This paper describes how the hydrometeorological time series and attributes were produced, their primary limitations, and their main spatial features. To facilitate comparisons with catchments from other countries, the data follow the same standards as the previous CAMELS (Catchment Attributes and MEteorology for Large-sample Studies) datasets for the United States, Chile, and Great Britain. CAMELS-BR (Brazil) complements the other CAMELS datasets by providing data for hundreds of catchments in the tropics and the Amazon rainforest. Importantly, precipitation and evapotranspiration uncertainties are assessed using several gridded products, and quantitative estimates of water consumption are provided to characterize human impacts on water resources. By extracting and combining data from these different data products and making CAMELS-BR publicly available, we aim to create new opportunities for hydrological research in Brazil and facilitate the inclusion of Brazilian basins in continental to global large-sample studies. We envision that this dataset will enable the community to gain new insights into the drivers of hydrological behavior, better characterize extreme hydroclimatic events, and explore the impacts of climate change and human activities on water resources in Brazil. The CAMELS-BR dataset is freely available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3709337 (Chagas et al., 2020).},

  abstract = {Dramatic land clearing occurred in Central Queensland of Australia in the 1960s to 1980s, and its impacts on streamflow are of great importance for regional water resources inventory and management. Paired catchment studies at the small scale (around 10-20 ha) have shown conclusively that clearing forests for agriculture has more than doubled the streamflow in the region. Two previous investigations at the large scale (the Comet basin with an area of 16,460 km2) have drawn quite different conclusions about the land clearing effect on streamflow, varying from 40\% increases in streamflow due to land clearing to all the changes in streamflow occurring as a result of climate variability. To further examine the effect of land clearing on streamflow at the large scale in Central Queensland, this study attempts to resolve the discrepancy of the two previous studies by applying the same set of methods (double mass curves, flow duration curves, Budyko framework, Tanh function and conceptual hydrologic model SimHyd) for three distinct periods, namely pre-clearing, transitional and post-clearing periods, and for two neighbouring large basins. The main conclusions of this study are: 1) the effect of land clearing on streamflow of large basins in Central Queensland are unmistakably detectable; 2) the impact of land clearing manifested itself mostly during wetter years or for wetter basins; 3) for a given basin, the greater the extent of land clearing the larger the effect on streamflow; and 4) a lack of consistent conclusions about the land use change effect on streamflow at the large scale for this region and for several other large basins around the world are likely a result of the different methodologies used, different contrasting periods, and the differing effect on streamflow in relation to the underlying climate variability.},

Here, high-resolution (1 m) LiDAR DEMs are employed to present a novel large-scale methodology using a more realistic estimation of bathymetry based on hydrogeomorphological GIS tools to extract water surface slope. The large-scale 1D/2D flood model LISFLOOD-FP is applied to validate the simulated flood levels using detailed water level data in four different watersheds in Quebec (Canada), including continuous profiles over extensive distances measured with the HydroBall technology. A GIS-automated procedure allows to obtain the average width required to run LISFLOOD-FP. The GIS-automated procedure to estimate bathymetry from LiDAR water surface data uses a hydraulic inverse problem based on discharge at the time of acquisition of LiDAR data. A tiling approach, allowing several small independent hydraulic simulations to cover an entire watershed, greatly improves processing time to simulate large watersheds with a 10-m resampled LiDAR DEM. Results show significant improvements to large-scale flood modelling at the watershed scale with standard deviation in the range of 0.30 m and an average fit of around 90\%. The main advantage of the proposed approach is to avoid the need to collect expensive bathymetry data to efficiently and accurately simulate flood levels over extensive areas.},

  abstract = {GCM downscaled climatic components are used to project extreme events such as drought and flood. GCM derived climatic derivatives induce uncertainties in projecting extreme events caused by climate change. The uncertainties occur due to uncertain emission scenarios, downscaling approach, and model parameterization uncertainty. Several approaches are proposed to overcome this shortcoming, but a recently developed bottom-up paradigm is helpful in the specific scenarios of extreme event projection and mitigation. In this work conventional, top-down approach (using the downscaled climate derivatives) is compared with a recently developed bottom-up framework in the projection of extreme events. The bottom-up approach works on the exploratory modeling framework where synthetic climate scenarios are generated using a delta change method. The proposed framework allows the extreme event's predictions, utilizing the available climatic data (precipitation and temperature). Furthermore, the concept of comparative hydrology is used to develop generalized predictions on catchment-scale for the Indian sub-continent. In this study, we focused on the impact of climate change on drought. We used a change in precipitation and temperature on the dynamics of drought indices like PDSI and SPEI across the Indian sub-continent. We compiled a dataset for 215 catchments' physio-climatic characteristics, consisting of climatic, hydrologic, vegetation, and soil properties. The vulnerability of the catchment to drought with the change in climate using 30 years of data is assessed using data-mining algorithms. This study will help in understanding the vulnerability to the drought of catchments under varying climatic conditions and will help stakeholders in mitigating the adverse effects of climate change.},

In this study, we combine the strengths of recently developed exploratory modeling frameworks and comparative hydrology to quantify the relationship between watershed's vulnerability and its physio-climatic characteristics. We propose a definition of vulnerability that can be used by a diverse range of water system managers and is useful in the presence of large uncertainties in drivers of environmental change. This definition is related to adverse climate change and land use thresholds that are quantified using a recently developed exploratory modeling approach. In this way, we estimate the vulnerability of 69 watersheds in the United States to climate and land use change. We explore definitions of vulnerability that describe average or extreme flow conditions, as well as others that are relevant from the point of view of instream organisms. In order to understand the dominant controls on vulnerability, we correlate these indices with watershed's characteristics describing its topography, geology, drainage, climate, and land use. We find that mean annual flow is more vulnerable to reductions in precipitation in watersheds with lower average soil permeability, lower baseflow index, lower forest cover, higher topographical wetness index, and vice-versa. Our results also indicate a potential mediation of climate change impacts by regional groundwater systems. By developing such relationships across a large range of watersheds, such information can potentially be used to assess the vulnerability of ungauged watersheds to uncertain environmental change.},

A common assumption in most modeling frameworks is that catchment's hydrologically relevant characteristics, represented via model parameters, remain constant. However, several studies present evidence on the contrary and suggest potential biases in estimates of future streamflow due to this assumption. Regardless, there is a lack of modeling frameworks that account for the possible impact of climate on catchment's characteristics. To change model parameters with climate, we propose a method based on the Whittaker biome plot that relates biome type to the climatic setting of a catchment. We compare estimates of catchment's vulnerability to climate change obtained from fixed and changing parameters. Our analysis spanning 83 catchments across the conterminous United States shows that considering changes in catchment's representative parameters with climate significantly alters the estimated vulnerability to climate change for a majority of catchments.},

  abstract = {Ensemble streamflow predictions (ESP) from a single hydrological model tend to under-sample the variability needed to provide a good representation of streamflow observations. ESPs typically end up being biased and under-dispersed, making them imprecise and less valuable in an operational context. In this study, a proposed methodology based on a multi-hydrological model approach is applied to address these issues. The forecast methodology includes eight lumped hydrological models whose states were updated through data assimilation using an Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) to provide initial states to the models, allowing them to better sample uncertainty in the hydrometeorological observations and reduce initial condition errors. ESP forecasts are then driven by numerical weather prediction ensemble forecasts of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) for a nine-day lead-time on five snowmelt-dominated catchments in Quebec, Canada. These eight assimilated individual ESPs are then post-processed using a quantile mapping bias correction method, after which they are combined in a larger ensemble (known as a Grand Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (GESP)) using a multi-model approach. Results indicate that the proposed methodology allowed reducing both forecast biases and under-dispersion problems for all catchments and four periods corresponding to the seasonality of the streamflow. On their own, the data assimilation (DA) and post-processing manipulations allowed shifting the hydrological ensembles to better encompass the observed streamflow. The multi-model approach further improved the forecasts by increasing their reliability. Talagrand diagrams, supported by the KolmogorovSmirnov test for uniformity, as well as the Average Bin Distance to Uniformity (ABDU) and the Continuous Ranked Probability Skill Score (CRPSS), were chosen as performance metrics to evaluate the robustness of the methodology. These findings suggest that it is possible to improve hydrological short-term forecast reliability through a multi-model approach in an operational forecasting context.},

In this paper, we describe the method of event coincidence analysis to provide a framework for quantifying the strength, directionality and time lag of statistical interrelationships between event series. Event coincidence analysis allows to formulate and test null hypotheses on the origin of the observed interrelationships including tests based on Poisson processes or, more generally, stochastic point processes with a prescribed inter-event time distribution and other higher-order properties. Applying the framework to country-level observational data yields evidence that flood events have acted as triggers of epidemic outbreaks globally since the 1950s. Facing projected future changes in the statistics of climatic extreme events, statistical techniques such as event coincidence analysis will be relevant for investigating the impacts of anthropogenic climate change on human societies and ecosystems worldwide.},

Using the MODIS standard land cover and LAI products, global LAI climatologies and statistics were obtained for both pure and mixed pixels to evaluate the effects of biome mixture on LAI estimation. Misclassification between crops and shrubs does not generally translate into large LAI errors ({$<$}0.37 or 27.0\%), partly due to their relatively lower LAI values. Biome misclassification generally leads to an LAI overestimation for savanna, but an underestimation for forests. The largest errors caused by misclassification are also found for savanna (0.51), followed by evergreen needleleaf forests (0.44) and broadleaf forests ({\textasciitilde}0.31). Comparison with MODIS uncertainty indicators show that biome misclassification is a major factor contributing to LAI uncertainties for savanna, while for forests, the main uncertainties may be introduced by algorithm deficits, especially in summer. The LAI climatologies for pure pixels are recommended for land surface modeling studies. Future studies should focus on improving the biome classification for savanna systems and refinement of the retrieval algorithms for forest biomes.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Assessing the relationship between the intensity, duration, and frequency (IDF) of extreme precipitation is required for the design of water management systems. However, when modeling sub-daily precipitation extremes, there are commonly only short observation time series available. This problem can be overcome by applying the duration-dependent formulation of the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution which fits an IDF model with a range of durations simultaneously. The originally proposed duration-dependent GEV model exhibits a power-law-like behavior of the quantiles and takes care of a deviation from this scaling relation (curvature) for sub-hourly durations (Koutsoyiannis et~al.,~1998). We suggest that a more flexible model might be required to model a wide range of durations (1\,min to 5\,d). Therefore, we extend the model with the following two features: (i)~different slopes for different quantiles (multiscaling) and (ii)~the deviation from the power law for large durations (flattening), which is newly introduced in this study. Based on the quantile skill score, we investigate the performance of the resulting flexible model with respect to the benefit of the individual features (curvature, multiscaling, and flattening) with simulated and empirical data. We provide detailed information on the duration and probability ranges for which specific features or a systematic combination of features leads to improvements for stations in a case study area in the Wupper catchment (Germany). Our results show that allowing curvature or multiscaling improves the model only for very short or long durations, respectively, but leads to disadvantages in modeling the other duration ranges. In contrast, allowing flattening on average leads to an improvement for medium durations between 1\,h and 1\,d, without affecting other duration regimes. Overall, the new parametric form offers a flexible and enhanced performance model for consistently describing IDF relations over a wide range of durations, which has not been done before as most existing studies focus on durations longer than 1\,h or day and do not address the deviation from the power law for very long durations (2{\textendash}5\,d).},

To verify and better characterize this trend, a thorough statistical analysis is undertaken. The analysis focuses on three aspects of precipitation: amount, frequency, and intensity at 6-hourly time scale and for each calendar month separately. At the NLDAS-2 native resolution of 0.1258 3 0.1258, Kendall's tau and Sen's slope estimators are used to detect and estimate trends and the Pettitt test is used to detect breakpoints. Parallel analyses are conducted on both NARR and Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2), subdaily precipitation estimates. Widespread breakpoints of field significance at the a 5 0.05 level are detected in the NLDAS-2 frequency and intensity series for all months and 6-h periods that are absent from the analogous NARR and MERRA-2 datasets. These breakpoints are shown to correspond with a July 1996 NLDAS-2 transition away from hourly 28 3 2.58 NOAA/ CPC precipitation estimates to hourly 4-km stage II Doppler radar precipitation estimates in the temporal disaggregation of CPC daily gauge analyses. While NLDAS-2 may provide the most realistic diurnal precipitation cycle overall, users should be aware of this discontinuity and its direct effect on long-term trends in subdaily precipitation and indirect effects on trends in modeled soil moisture, surface temperature, surface energy and water fluxes, snow cover, snow water equivalent, and runoff/streamflow.},

When these buckets approach empty, the simulated evapotranspiration approaches zero, which places an implicit limit on the soil moisture deficit that can accrue within the model. Such models may cease to properly track the moisture deficit accumulating in reality as dry conditions continue, leading to overestimation of subsequent runoff and possible long-term bias under drying climate. Here, we suggest that model realism may be improved through alternatives which remove the upper limit on simulated soil moisture deficit, such as ``bottomless'' buckets or deficit-based soil moisture accounting. While some existing models incorporate such measures, no study until now has systematically assessed their impact on model realism under drying climate. Here, we alter a common bucket model by changing the soil moisture storage to a deficit ac\- counting system in such a way as to remove the upper limit on simulated soil moisture deficit. Tested on 38 Australian catchments, the altered model is better able to track the decline in soil moisture at the end of seasonal dry periods, which leads to superior performance over varied historic climate, including the 13-year ``Millen\- nium'' drought. However, groundwater and GRACE data reveal long-term trends that are not matched in sim\- ulations, indicating that further changes may be required. Nonetheless, the results suggest that a broader adoption of bottomless buckets and/or deficit accounting within conceptual rainfall runoff models may improve the realism of runoff projections under drying climate.},

  abstract = {Rainfall-runoff models are often deficient under changing climatic conditions, yet almost no recent studies propose new or improved model structures, instead focusing on model intercomparison, input sensitivity, and/or quantification of uncertainty. This paucity of progress in model development is (in part) due to the difficulty of distinguishing which cases of model failure are truly caused by structural inadequacy. Here we propose a new framework to diagnose the salient cause of poor model performance in changing climate conditions, be it structural inadequacy, poor parameterization, or data errors. The framework can be applied to a single catchment, although larger samples of catchments are helpful to generalize and/or cross-check results. To generate a diagnosis, multiple historic periods with contrasting climate are defined, and the limits of model robustness and flexibility are explored over each period separately and for all periods together. Numerous data-based checks also supplement the results. Using a case study catchment from Australia, improved inference of structural failure and clearer evaluation of model structural improvements are demonstrated. This framework enables future studies to (i) identify cases where poor simulations are due to poor calibration methods or data errors, remediating these cases without recourse to structural changes; and (ii) use the remaining cases to gain greater clarity into what structural changes are needed to improve model performance in changing climate. Plain Language Summary Rainfall runoff models are tools used by hydrologists in climate change assessments to estimate how future streamflow might change in response to a given (often hypothetical) climate scenario. For example, suppose we can assume that rainfall in a particular location is going to reduce by 20\% in the future. Does this mean that streamflow will also reduce by 20\%? Or will it be 10\% less or 40\% less? Although rainfall runoff models are among the best tools available, they are often not very good at answering this question. When tested on historical multiyear droughts, they often perform poorly, and we are unsure why. One problem is that when a model fails in this task, it is difficult to know what went wrong. Perhaps there was a problem with the data, since environmental monitoring is often subject to large errors. Perhaps the problem lay not with the model itself but with the way it was trained, or calibrated, to the data. Lastly, perhaps the model itself{\textemdash}its mathematical equations{\textemdash}need to be changed. To improve our estimates, we need a method to test which cause is behind the model failure; otherwise, we might make changes where none are warranted. This paper proposes such a method, in the form of a multistep framework that can isolate the causes of model failures. By ensuring that our attention is focused in the correct direction, this framework will help us to understand and make better estimates of how river flow will be altered by a changing climate.},

A global-scale synthesis of the multivariate drought risk considering interdependencies between drought attributes across disparate climate regimes is still lacking. Leveraging precipitation and streamflow observations of 270 large catchments over the globe, we show that multivariate drought hazard amplifies significantly (at {$\sim$}65{\textendash}76\% of catchments) considering dependence between drought duration and severity. A signifying nature of this amplification (A) is the power-law scaling with dependence m{$\mathsl{A}\mathsl{A}$}etric ({$\mathsl{A}\mathsl{A}$} {$\propto$} {$\mathsl{T}\mathsl{T}\mathsl{\lambda}\mathsl{\lambda}$}; {$\mathsl{\lambda}\mathsl{\lambda}$} = 5 - 12; where {$\tau$} and {$\lambda$} are Kendall's correlation and the scaling exponent), revealing current approaches considering drought attributes as independent or linearly dependent will severely underestimate likelihood of extreme droughts. Furthermore, we find disparate responses in the multivariate imprints of meteorological to hydrological droughts across climate types, with strengths varying from large to modest in Tropics and Mid-latitudes, which indicates weaker overlap between rain-deficit and streamflow droughts. In contrast, a strong overlap in multivariate hazards of rain-deficit and streamflow droughts is apparent across transitional Subtropics. Our study highlights the relevance of accounting for multivariate aspects of drought hazards to inform adaptation to water scarcity in a changing climate.},

Generation of synthetic daily weather data is a common approach to augment limited weather observations. Here a synthetic daily weather generation model (called SYNTOR) is described. SYNTOR fulfills the traditional role of generating alternative weather realizations that have statistical properties similar to those of the parent historical weather it is intended to simulate. In addition, it has the capability to simulate daily weather records for climate change scenarios and storm intensification due to climate change. The various model components are briefly summarized and an application is presented for semi-arid climate conditions in west-central Oklahoma. SYNTOR generated daily weather compared well with observed weather values. Climate change is simulated by adjusting weather generation parameters to reflect the changed mean monthly weather values of climate projections. Storm intensification is approximated by increasing the top 10 percentile of storm distribution by a predefined amount based on previous studies of trends in United States precipitation. Further evaluation of published storm intensification values and associated uncertainties and spatial variability is recommended.},

There have been numerous studies before and since the launch of the predictions in ungauged basins (PUB) initiative by the International Association of Hydrological Sciences in 2003. This study critically reviews and assesses the decadal progress in the regionalization of hydrological modeling, which is the major tool for PUB, from 2000 to 2019. This paper found that the journal publications have noticeably increased in terms of PUB in the past 7 years, and research countries have been expanded dramatically since 2013. The regionalization methods are grouped into three categories including similarity-based, regression-based, and hydrological signature-based. There are more detailed researches focusing on the interdisciplinary and profound improvement of each regionalization method. Namely, tremendous efforts have been made and lots of improvements have been carried out in the parameterization domain for the post-PUB period. However, there is still plenty of room to improve the prediction capability in data-sparse regions (e.g., further verification and proof of multi-modeling adaptation and uncertainties description). This paper also discusses possible research directions in the future, including PUB in a changing environment and better utilization of multi-source remote-sensing information.},

Here, we present a diagnostically interesting decomposition of NSE (and hence MSE), which facilitates analysis of the relative importance of its different components in the context of hydrological modelling, and show how model calibration problems can arise due to interactions among these components. The analysis is illustrated by calibrating a simple conceptual precipitation-runoff model to daily data for a number of Austrian basins having a broad range of hydro-meteorological characteristics. Evaluation of the results clearly demonstrates the problems that can be associated with any calibration based on the NSE (or MSE) criterion. While we propose and test an alternative criterion that can help to reduce model calibration problems, the primary purpose of this study is not to present an improved measure of model performance. Instead, we seek to show that there are systematic problems inherent with any optimization based on formulations related to the MSE. The analysis and results have implications to the manner in which we calibrate and evaluate environmental models; we discuss these and suggest possible ways forward that may move us towards an improved and diagnostically meaningful approach to model performance evaluation and identification.},

This methodology of climate change impact modeling was developed and demonstrated through application to a hydropower plant in the Rio Jubones Basin in Ecuador. ArcSWAT 2012 was used to develop a model for simulating the river flow. The model parameters were calibrated and validated on a monthly scale with respect to the hydro-meteorological inputs observed from 1985 to 1991 and from 1992 to 1998, respectively. Statistical analyses produced Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies (NSEs) of 0.66 and 0.61 for model calibration and validation, respectively, which were considered acceptable. Numerical simulation with the model indicated that climate change could alter the seasonal flow regime of the basin, and the hydropower potential could change due to the changing climate in the future. Scenario analysis indicates that, though the hydropower generation will increase in the wet season, the plant will face a significant power shortage during the dry season, up to 13.14\% from the reference scenario, as a consequence of a 17\% reduction of streamflow under an assumption of a 2.9C increase in temperature and a 15\% decrease in rainfall. Overall, this study showed that hydrological processes are realistically modeled with SWAT and the model can be a useful tool for predicting the impact of climate change.},

  abstract = {Reproducibility is a foundational principle in scientific research. Yet in computational hydrology the code and data that actually produces published results are not regularly made available, inhibiting the ability of the community to reproduce and verify previous findings. In order to overcome this problem we recommend that reuseable code and formal workflows, which unambiguously reproduce published scientific results, are made available for the community alongside data, so that we can verify previous findings, and build directly from previous work. In cases where reproducing large-scale hydrologic studies is computationally very expensive and time-consuming, new processes are required to ensure scientific rigor. Such changes will strongly improve the transparency of hydrological research, and thus provide a more credible foundation for scientific advancement and policy support.},

  abstract = {Forested watersheds provide important ecosystem services through the provision of high quality freshwater, mitigation of floods, and maintenance of base flows. How alteration of these services under ongoing climate change is mediated by vegetation dynamics is not fully understood. Combining independent remote sensing based vegetation information and distributed hydrological modeling, we investigated the impact of climate-induced vegetation dynamics on long-term non-stationary hydrologic behavior in two forested watersheds in the southern Appalachians. We found significant increases in precipitationrunoff deficit (defined as annual precipitation minus annual runoff), equivalent to annual evapotranspiration plus storage changes, over the last three decades. This non-stationary hydrologic behavior was significantly correlated with long-term and interannual changes in growing season length and subsequent vegetation growth. These patterns in vegetation phenology were attributed primarily to minimum temperature regimes, which showed steeper and more consistent increases than temperature maxima. Using a distributed modeling framework, we also found that the long-term non-stationary hydrologic behavior could not be simulated unless full vegetation dynamics, including vegetation phenology and long-term growth, were incorporated into the model. Incorporating seasonal vegetation dynamics also led to the improved simulation in streamflow dynamics, while its effect spread out through the following dormant seasons. Our study indicates that non-stationary hydrologic behavior has been closely mediated by long-term seasonal and structural forest canopy interaction with climate variables rather than directly driven by climatic variables. This study emphasizes the importance of understanding the ecosystem responses to ongoing climate change for predictions of future freshwater regimes.},

Geo-stationary satellites provide continuous and synoptic observations over large areas on weather including cyclone monitoring. Polar orbiting satellites have the advantage of providing much higher resolution imageries, even though at low temporal frequency, which could be used for detailed monitoring, damage assessment and long-term relief management. Advancements in the remote sensing technology and the Geographic Information Systems help in real time monitoring, early warning and quick damage assessment of both drought and flood disasters.

  abstract = {Climate change presents severe risks for the implementation and success of environmental flows worldwide. Current environmental flow assessments tend to assume climate stationarity, so there is an urgent need for robust environmental flow programs that allow adaptation to changing flow regimes due to climate change. Designing and implementing robust environmental flow programs means ensuring environmental objectives are achieved under a range of uncertain, but plausible climate futures. We apply stress testing concepts previously adopted in water supply management to environmental flows at a catchment scale. We do this by exploring vulnerabilities in different river management metrics for current environmental flow arrangements in the Goulburn River, Australia, under non-stationary climatic conditions. Given the limitations of current environmental flows in supporting ecological outcomes under climate change, we tested three different adaptation options individually and in combination. Stress testing adaptation results showed that increasing environmental entitlements yielded the largest benefits in drier climate futures, whereas relaxing river capacity constraints (allowing more targeted delivery of environmental water) offered more benefits for current and wetter climates. Combining both these options led to greater than additive improvements in allocation reliability and reductions in environmental water shortfalls, and these improvements were achieved across a wider range of climatic conditions than possible with either of the individual options. However, adaptation may present additional risks to some ecological outcomes for wetter climates. Ultimately, there was a degree of plausible climate change beyond which none of the adaptation options considered were effective at improving ecological outcomes. This study demonstrates an important step for environmental flow assessments: evaluating the feasibility of environmental outcomes under climate change, and the intervention options that prove most robust under an uncertain future.},

The system produces series at a daily time resolution, using two stochastic models in series: first, for rainfall which produces an output series which is then used for a second model generating the other variables dependent on rainfall. The series are intended for single sites defined nationally across the UK at a 5 km resolution, but can be generated to be representative across small catchments ({$<$}1000 km2). Scenarios can be generated for the control period (1961e1990) based on observed data, as well as for the UK Climate Impacts Programme (UKCIP02) scenarios for three time slices (2020s, 2050s and 2080s). Future scenarios are generated by fitting the models to observations which have been perturbed by application of change factors derived from the UKCIP02 mean projected changes in that variable. These change factors are readily updated, as new scenarios become available, and with suitable calibration data the approach could be extended to any geographical region.},

Perturbation of the reshuffled variable data is also added to enhance the generation of extreme values. The Upper Thames River Basin in Ontario, Canada is used as a case study and the model is shown to simulate effectively the historical characteristics at the site.

This contribution demonstrates that accurate uncertainty predictions can be obtained with deep learning. We establish an uncertainty estimation benchmarking procedure and present four deep learning baselines. Three baselines are based on mixture density networks, and one is based on Monte Carlo dropout. The results indicate that these approaches constitute strong baselines, especially the former ones. Additionally, we provide a post hoc model analysis to put forward some qualitative understanding of the resulting models. The analysis extends the notion of performance and shows that the model learns nuanced behaviors to account for different situations.},

  abstract = {The increasing risk of floods across the globe needs focused attention because of the extensive damage to human lives and economy. A comprehensive understanding of its causative factors is of vital importance. Yet catchment characterization studies are generally limited to case studies or regional domains. A comprehensive global characterization is currently unavailable, which requires collecting and collating a large number of datasets over vast areas. This study embraces large-sample data-driven science as a new paradigm to characterize streamflow extremes by utilizing global datasets of physiographic explanatory variables that could explain various facets of extreme streamflows. Along with the spatial and temporal variations of high streamflow extremes, their corre\- lation with various catchment characteristics such as geomorphology, meteorology, climatology, landcover, li\- thology, etc. were examined. The multidimensional relationships between the streamflow extremes and catchment characteristics were modeled using a Random Forest approach and combined with an interpretable machine learning framework to identify the most dominant factors in varying climate classes. Interpretation with SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) reveals that meteorological variables are the most influential variables across the climatic classes. However, the variables and their influences change among different climatic classes. Moreover, different geomorphological variables come into dominance across climatic classes (such as basin relief in warm temperate and drainage texture in arid climates). Overall, the insights from the study could play a crucial role in predicting the unit peak discharge at ungauged stations from the known catchment characteristics. Moreover, these findings can also play a crucial role in formulating risk management strategy.},

However, a reliable assessment of the water budget and water yield for the Indian sub-continental river basins has been lacking. We used 0.25{$\smwhtcircle$} gridded meteorological observations and five hydrological models to construct water budget estimates for the Indian sub-continental river basins for the 1951{\textendash}2016 period. The hydrological models (i.e. VIC, CLM, Noah-MP, H08, and CWatM) were calibrated against observed streamflow and evaluated for evapotranspiration (ET) and soil moisture. Considerable uncertainty in the water budget components (ET and total runoff) was found due to the process representation and parameterization of hydrological models. Multi\- model ensemble mean of the five hydrological models performed better than individual models for most basins for water budget components. West coast, Brahmaputra, and Brahmani are the three wettest river basins. At the same time, Sabarmati, Indus, and Pennar are the three driest basins in terms of mean annual precipitation in the Indian sub-continent. The three transboundary river basins (Brahmaputra, Ganga, and Indus) have the highest water yield of 731.9 ({$\pm$}50.2), 582.4 ({$\pm$}89.4), and 231.1({$\pm$}71) km3, respectively. The Budyko framework showed that only two basins (West Coast and the Brahmaputra) over the Indian sub-continent fall under the energylimited (relatively lower atmospheric water demands) conditions. In comparison, the other sixteen river ba\- sins are in water-limited (higher atmospheric water demands) condition. Our findings have implications for water resources planning and management in one of the world's most populated regions.},

However, quantifying the changes in future flood flashiness is challenging due to the lack of high-resolution climate simulations. Here we use outputs from a continental convective-permitting numerical weather model at 4-km and hourly resolution and force a numerical hydrologic model at a continental scale to depict such change. As results indicate, US floods are becoming 7.9\% flashier by the end of the century assuming a high-emissions scenario. The Southwest (+10.5\%) has the greatest increase in flashiness among historical flash flood hot spots, and the central US (+8.6\%) is emerging as a new flash flood hot spot. Additionally, future flash flood-prone frontiers are advancing northwards. This study calls on implementing climate-resilient mitigation measures for emerging flash flood hot spots.},

  abstract = {Light canopy transmittance and the Beer-Lambert equation were utilized to assess monthly leaf area index (LAI) of a tropical deciduous forest ecosystem on the west coast of Mexico. The light transmittance coefficient (k) was obtained by analyzing vertical leaf and light distribution in the forest canopy. An independent LAI estimate was obtained using litterfall data. The calculated k value was 0.610 {$\pm$}0.035 (standard error). Average maximum LAI obtained with litterfall data was 4.2 + 0.4 m2 m{\textasciitilde}2. There was a significant correlation (P{$<$} 0.001, r= 0.98) between litter-LAI estimations and those obtained with the Beer-Lambert equation. The regression explained 95\% of the variation; however, light-LAI overestimated litter-LAI by a constant of 0.87{$\pm$}0.12 m2 m{\textasciitilde}2 (the slope was 1.03 and Y intercept was 0.87). The discrepancy is partially attributed to leaf retention of the few evergreen species, and perhaps leaf retention of a few deciduous species beyond the end of the litterfall collection. Maximum annual LAI was similar in both study years (4.5{$\pm$}0.3 m2 m{\textasciitilde}2 in 1990 and 4.9{$\pm$}0.4 in 1991). Minimum LAI showed considerable variation between years with similar values in the dry seasons of 1990 and 1991 (1.0 {$\pm$}0.1 m2 and 0.9 + 0.1 m2 mr2, respectively), but much higher values in 1992 (2.7 + 0.2 m2 m{\textasciitilde}2). The difference is probably attributed to an atypical rainfall event in January 1992 (644 mm), which retarded leaf abscission.},

Four global climate models (GCMs), three greenhouse gas emission scenarios (RCPs) and six downscaling methods (DSMs) are used in the assessment. These sources of uncertainty are analyzed separately for two future time periods (2036 to 2065 and 2066 to 2095). An uncertainty metric is calculated based on the variation in simulated precipitation due to choice of GCMs, emission scenarios and downscaling models. The results show that the selection of a downscaling method provides the largest amount of uncertainty when compared to the choice of GCM and/or emission scenario. However, the choice of GCM provides a significant amount of uncertainty if downscaling methods are not considered. This assessment work is conducted at ten different locations in the Campbell River basin.},

Increasingly, signatures are being used in large sample studies to guide flow management and modelling at continental scales. Using signatures in studies involving 1000s of watersheds brings new challenges as it becomes impractical to examine signature parameters and behaviour in each watershed. For example, we might wish to check that signatures describing flood event characteristics have correctly identified event periods, that signature values have not been biassed by data errors, or that human and natural influences on signature values have been correctly interpreted. In this commentary, we draw from our collective experience to present case studies where na{\"i}ve application of signatures fails to correctly identify streamflow dynamics. These include unusual precipitation or flow regimes, data quality issues, and signature use in human-influenced watersheds. We conclude by providing guidance and recommendations on applying signatures in large sample studies.},

  abstract = {Direct runoff and baseflow are the two primary components of total streamflow, and their accurate estimation is indispensable for a variety of hydrologic applications. While direct runoff is the quick response stemming from surface and shallow subsurface flow paths and is often associated with floods, baseflow represents the groundwater contribution from stored sources (e.g., groundwater) to streams and is crucial for environmental flow regulations, and water supply, among others. L'vovich (1979, https:// doi.org/10.1029/SP013) proposed a two-step water balance partitioning, where precipitation is divided into direct runoff and catchment wetting, followed by the disaggregation of the latter into baseflow and evapotranspiration. Here, we investigate the role of the aridity index (ratio between mean-annual potential evapotranspiration and precipitation) in controlling the long-term (mean-annual) fluxes of direct runoff and baseflow. We present an analytical solution beginning with similar assumptions as proposed by Budyko (1974, https://www.elsevier.com/books/climate-and-life/budyko/978-0-12-139450-9), leading to two complementary expressions for the two fluxes. The aridity index explained 77\% and 89\% of variability in direct runoff and baseflow from 378 catchments within the continental United States, while our formulations were able to reproduce the patterns of water balance partitioning proposed by L'vovich (1979, https://doi.org/10.1029/SP013) at the mean-annual timescale. Our approach can be used to further understand how climate and landscape controls the terrestrial water balance at mean-annual timescales, while also representing a step toward the prediction of baseflow and direct runoff at ungauged basins.},

  abstract = {Hydrometeorological droughts are complex hazards expressed through the relative deviation in water availability relative to long-term average conditions. The development and propagation of drought is governed by hydrological processes at different spatial scales including precipitation, evapotranspiration, overland flow, soil moisture, groundwater storage and discharge. Detailed investigation is thus required to evaluate associated linkages among various types of hydrometeorological drought to understand the likely impacts of climate change on drought characteristics (magnitude, frequency, duration and propagation). This study explores the impact of climate change on hydrometeorological drought for 10 Irish catchments, using standardized drought indices representing different components of the hydrological system. We employ 12 Global Climate Models from the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6), forced with SSP370 and bias corrected to catchment conditions to force a conceptual hydrological model to generate hydrological projections for each catchment. The results indicate substantial drying during summer with associated increases in summer drought magnitude and frequency. However, simulations show a wide range of change, especially for hydrological drought (discharge and baseflow). Only modest changes in the magnitude and frequency of hydrological drought events were found, with increases in winter and spring precipitation offsetting summer dryness. Similarly, the probability of meteorological drought propagating to hydrological events (Standardized Streamflow Index/Standardized Baseflow Index), shows modest increases under the climate change projections considered. Findings highlight that drought, especially during summer are a critical climate change risk for adaptation.},

  abstract = {We simulate the water balance dynamics of 308 catchments in Austria using a lumped conceptual model involving 11 calibration parameters. We calibrate and verify the model for two non-overlapping 11-year periods of daily runoff data. A comparison of the calibrated parameter values of the two periods suggests that all parameters are associated with some uncertainty although the degree of uncertainty differs between the parameters. The regional patterns of the calibrated parameters can be interpreted based on hydrological process reasoning indicating that they are able to represent the regional or large-scale differences in the hydrological conditions. Catchment attributes explain some of the spatial parameter variability with coefficients of determination of up to R2 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0:27; but usually the R2 values are lower. Parameter uncertainty does not seem to cloud the relationship between calibrated parameters and catchment attributes to a significant extent as suggested by an optimised correlation analysis. The median Nash {\textendash}Sutcliffe efficiencies of simulating streamflow decrease from 0.67 to 0.63 when moving from the calibration to the verification period. This is a small decrease, which suggests that problems with overparameterisation of the model are unlikely. We then compare regionalisation methods for estimating the model parameters in ungauged catchments, in terms of the model performance. The best regionalisation methods are the use of the average parameters of immediate upstream and downstream (nested) neighbours and regionalisation by kriging. For the calibration period, the average decrease in the Nash{\textendash} Sutcliffe model efficiency, as a result of the regionalisation, is 0.10 which is about twice the decrease of moving from the calibration to the verification period. The methods based on multiple regressions with catchment attributes perform significantly poorer. Apparently, spatial proximity is a better surrogate of unknown controls on runoff dynamics than catchment attributes.},

To bridge this gap and facilitate future freshwater research opportunities, we harmonized existing global datasets to create the Global Lake area, Climate, and Population (GLCP) dataset.

The GLCP was created with FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) data principles in mind and retains unique identifiers from parent datasets to expedite interoperability.

The critical balance between the hydrological parameters and the flora and fauna makes it susceptible to larger implications due to the warming rates of climate. This zone comprises about 12 river basins, out of which the Indus forms the most important and extensive river system along with its tributaries and water bodies spreading over several countries. Indus River plays an important role to fulfill the water requirement of agriculture and domestic use in the Himalayan region. The present study was conducted to evaluate the impact of climate change on water resources in the Himalayan region and its sustainability. An in-depth inventory of the basin was discussed in the light of the changing climatic conditions. Research carried out in the Himalayan region on water resources in climate change scenario is reviewed and the effects of climate change on precipitation, river flows, glaciers, and extreme hydrological events have been discussed. The change in climate often leads to higher rates of evapo-transpiration, lesser rainfall, and drying up of the basin. The researchers have clearly indicated adverse changes in the hydrological cycle, water reserves, biodiversity and the quality of human life in the region because of the global warming. The study of the warming trends, decreasing precipitation, increased climate-induced disasters such as floods and Glacier Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) will help in minimizing the adverse impact of climate change on hydrology and water resources of the basin by developing strategies to attain sustainable development and management of the whole region.},

  abstract = {During the summer monsoon (June{\textendash}September) season, drought poses challenges for agricultural activities and water availability in India. We develop a framework considering the timing, areal coverage and severity that can be used for the assessment of meteorological droughts as the monsoon season progresses. We estimate the benchmark worst droughts within the monsoon season (June, July, August and September) using the long-term (1901{\textendash}2020) gridded rainfall. The benchmark worst droughts were identified considering the extent and severity of drought using the Drought Severity Coverage Index (DSCI). The worst meteorological drought in June, July, August and September occurred in 1923, 2002, 1937 and 1907 with a return period of 68, 200, 147, 188 years, respectively. The worst drought in the entire summer monsoon season occurred in 1918, which had a return period of 238 years. The benchmark droughts during June 1923, July 2002 and monsoon 1918 were associated with the warm sea surface temperature over the equatorial Pacific Ocean. The other two droughts (1937 and 1907) were linked with the off-equatorial warming over the Indo-Pacific region. The leading mode of variability in~the Standardized Precipitation Index obtained from empirical orthogonal function analysis showed that the western and central parts of the country are most affected by droughts during the summer monsoon season. The second leading mode exhibited declining trends in rainfall with a bipolar spatial variability centred over the Gangetic Plain and southern India. The estimated DSCI for a 2{\textendash}500 return period can be used for the drought assessment during the monsoon season in India.

  abstract = {In recent years droughts have been occurring frequently, and their impacts are being aggravated by the rise in water demand and the variability in hydro-meteorological variables due to climate change. As a result, drought hydrology has been receiving much attention. A variety of concepts have been applied to modeling droughts, ranging from simplistic approaches to more complex models. It is important to understand different modeling approaches as well as their advantages and limitations. This paper, supplementing the previous paper (Mishra and Singh, 2010) where different concepts of droughts were highlighted, reviews different methodologies used for drought modeling, which include drought forecasting, probability based modeling, spatio-temporal analysis, use of Global Climate Models (GCMs) for drought scenarios, land data assimilation systems for drought modeling, and drought planning. It is found that there have been significant improvements in modeling droughts over the past three decades. Hybrid models, incorporating large scale climate indices, seem to be promising for long lead-time drought forecasting. Further research is needed to understand the spatio-temporal complexity of droughts under climate change due to changes in spatio-temporal variability of precipitation. Applications of copula based models for multivariate drought characterization seem to be promising for better drought characterization. Research on decision support systems should be advanced for issuing warnings, assessing risk, and taking precautionary measures, and the effective ways for the flow of information from decision makers to users need to be developed. Finally, some remarks are made regarding the future outlook for drought research.},

The package includes a stochastic ordered allocation procedure as well as an implementation of the CLUE-S algorithm. We demonstrate its functionality by simulating land use change at the Plum Island Ecosystems site, using a data set included with the package. It is envisaged that lulcc will enable future model development and comparison within an open environment.},

We consider both intensity and frequency-based extreme indices for precipitation. The analysis is performed over both large-scale domains as well as regional scales (22 Giorgi land regions). We find that precipitation extremes are substantially reduced in geoengineering simulation: the magnitude of change is much smaller than those that occur in a simulation with elevated atmospheric CO2 alone. In the geoengineered climate, though the global mean of the intensity of extreme precipitation events is slightly less than in control climate, substantial changes remain on regional scales. We do not find significant changes in the frequency of precipitation extremes in geoengineering simulation compared to control simulation on global and regional scales. We infer that SRM schemes are likely to reduce precipitation extremes and the associated impacts on a global scale. However, we note that a comprehensive assessment of moral, social, ethical, legal, technological, economic, political and governance issues is required for using SRM methods to counter the impacts of climate change.},

Criteria used for assessing models are hydrological components that the model can simulate, the leading equations used to simulate the hydrologic components, requirements of the minimum data necessary to run the model, and the spatiotemporal scale of the model.

We present a community data set of daily forcing and hydrologic response data for 671 small- to medium-sized basins across the contiguous United States (median basin size of 336 km2) that spans a very wide range of hydroclimatic conditions. Area-averaged forcing data for the period 1980{\textendash}2010 was generated for three basin spatial configurations {\textendash} basin mean, hydrologic response units (HRUs) and elevation bands {\textendash} by mapping daily, gridded meteorological data sets to the subbasin (Daymet) and basin polygons (Daymet, Maurer and NLDAS). Daily streamflow data was compiled from the United States Geological Survey National Water Information System. The focus of this paper is to (1) present the data set for community use and (2) provide a model performance benchmark using the coupled Snow-17 snow model and the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting Model, calibrated using the shuffled complex evolution global optimization routine. After optimization minimizing daily root mean squared error, 90\% of the basins have Nash{\textendash}Sutcliffe efficiency scores {$\geq$}0.55 for the calibration period and 34\% {$\geq$} 0.8. This benchmark provides a reference level of hydrologic model performance for a commonly used model and calibration system, and highlights some regional variations in model performance. For example, basins with a more pronounced seasonal cycle generally have a negative low flow bias, while basins with a smaller seasonal cycle have a positive low flow bias. Finally, we find that data points with extreme error (defined as individual days with a high fraction of total error) are more common in arid basins with limited snow and, for a given aridity, fewer extreme error days are present as the basin snow water equivalent increases.},

Pervasive ecosystem transformations occurred in response to warming and associated climatic changes during the last glacial-to-interglacial transition, which was comparable in magnitude to warming projected for the next century under high-emission scenarios. We reviewed 594 published paleoecological records to examine compositional and structural changes in terrestrial vegetation since the last glacial period and to project the magnitudes of ecosystem transformations under alternative future emission scenarios. Our results indicate that terrestrial ecosystems are highly sensitive to temperature change and suggest that, without major reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere, terrestrial ecosystems worldwide are at risk of major transformation, with accompanying disruption of ecosystem services and impacts on biodiversity.},

The results of the analysis suggest that precipitation is the most important climatic element as an input into meteorological drought. It can, therefore, be concluded that for meteorological purposes, and when undertaking single-station analysis, simple indices with rainfall as the only input perform comparatively as well as the more complicated indices in depicting periods and intensity of drought.},

Several machine learning concepts and methods are notably relevant toward addressing the major challenges of formalizing and optimizing probabilistic forecasting implementations, as well as the equally important challenge of identifying the most useful ones among these implementations. Nonetheless, practically-oriented reviews focusing on such concepts and methods, and on how these can be effectively exploited in the above-outlined essential endeavor, are currently missing from the probabilistic hydrological forecasting literature. This absence holds despite the pronounced intensification in the research efforts for benefitting from machine learning in this same literature. It also holds despite the substantial relevant progress that has recently emerged, especially in the field of probabilistic hydrological post-processing, which traditionally provides the hydrologists with probabilistic hydrological forecasting implementations. Herein, we aim to fill this specific gap. In our review, we emphasize key ideas and information that can lead to effective popularizations, as such an emphasis can support successful future implementations and further scientific developments. In the same forward-looking direction, we identify open research questions and propose ideas to be explored in the future.},

  abstract = {Streamflow data are essential for the calibration of continuous rainfall{\textendash}runoff (RR) models. The quantity and quality of streamflow data can significantly influence parameter calibration and thus model robustness. Most existing sensitivity analysis studies on the role of streamflow data have used continuous periods to calibrate model parameters, with a minimum of one year, though ideally much longer periods are generally advised. However, in practical model applications, streamflow data series available for model calibration may be rather short or non-continuous. This study aims at assessing the sensitivity of continuous RR models to the quantity of information used during model calibration when it is randomly sampled in the observed hydrograph, i.e. using non-continuous calibration periods. This sampling provides less auto-correlated streamflow information for model calibration than continuous records. Two daily RR models with four and six free parameters were tested on a sample of 12 basins in the USA to obtain more general conclusions. The results showed that, in general, 350 calibration days sampled out of a longer data set including dry and wet conditions are sufficient to obtain robust estimates of model parameters. The more parsimonious model requires fewer calibration data to obtain stable and robust parameter values. Stable parameter values prove more difficult to reach in the driest catchments.},

Here, we explore the spectrum of current practice in hypothesis formulation and testing in hydrology, based on a random sample of recent research papers. This analysis suggests that in hydrology, as in other fields, hypothesis formulation and testing rarely correspond to the idealized model of the scientific method. Practices such as ``p-hacking'' or ``HARKing'' (Hypothesizing After the Results are Known) are major obstacles to more rigorous hypothesis testing in hydrology, along with the well-known problem of confirmation bias{\textemdash}the tendency to value and trust confirmations more than refutations{\textemdash}among both researchers and reviewers. Nonetheless, as several examples illustrate, hypothesis tests have played an essential role in spurring major advances in hydrological theory. Hypothesis testing is not the only recipe for scientific progress, however. Exploratory research, driven by innovations in measurement and observation, has also underlain many key advances. Further improvements in observation and measurement will be vital to both exploratory research and hypothesis testing, and thus to advancing the science of hydrology.},

  abstract = {Catchment flow regimes alteration is likely to be a prominent consequence of climate change projections in the Mediterranean. Here we explore the potential effects of climatic change on the flow regime of the Thau and the Chiba catchments which are located in Southern France and Northeastern Tunisia, respectively. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrological model is forced with projections from an ensemble of 4 climate model (CM) to assess changes and uncertainty in relevant hydrological indicators related to water balance, magnitude, frequency and timing of the flow between a reference (1971{\textendash}2000) and future (2041{\textendash}2071) periods. Results indicate that both catchments are likely to experience a decrease in precipitation and increase in temperature in the future. Consequently, runoff and soil water content are projected to decrease whereas potential evapotranspiration is likely to increase in both catchments. Yet uncertain, the projected magnitudes of these changes are higher in the wet period than in the dry period. Analyses of extreme flow show similar trend in both catchments, projecting a decrease in both high flow and low flow magnitudes for various time durations. Further, significant increase in low flow frequency as a proxy for hydrological droughts is projected for both catchments but with higher uncertainty in the wet period than in the dry period. Although no changes in the average timing of maximum and minimum flow events for different flow durations are projected, substantial uncertainty remains in the hydrological projections. While the results in both catchments show consistent trend of change for most of the hydrologic indicators, the overall degree of alteration on the flow regime of the Chiba catchment is projected to be higher than that of the Thau catchment. The projected magnitudes of alteration as well as their associated uncertainty vary depending on the catchment characteristics and flow seasonality.},

  abstract = {Climate change scenarios with a high spatial and temporal resolution are required in the evaluation of the effects of climate change on agricultural potential and agricultural risk. Such scenarios should reproduce changes in mean weather characteristics as well as incorporate the changes in climate variability indicated by the global climate model (GCM) used. Recent work on the sensitivity of crop models and climatic extremes has clearly demonstrated that changes in variability can have more profound effects on crop yield and on the probability of extreme weather events than simple changes in the mean values. The construction of climate change scenarios based on spatial regression downscaling and on the use of a local stochastic weather generator is described. Regression downscaling translated the coarse resolution GCM grid-box predictions of climate change to site-specific values. These values were then used to perturb the parameters of the stochastic weather generator in order to simulate site-specific daily weather data. This approach permits the incorporation of changes in the mean and variability of climate in a consistent and computationally inexpensive way. The stochastic weather generator used in this study, LARS-WG, has been validated across Europe and has been shown to perform well in the simulation of different weather statistics, including those climatic extremes relevant to agriculture. The importance of downscaling and the incorporation of climate variability are demonstrated at two European sites where climate change scenarios were constructed using the UK Met.

Changepoint analysis using the sequential Mann{\textendash}Kendall test showed two distinct periods (1901{\textendash}47 and 1948{\textendash}2012) for the domain-averaged monsoon season (June{\textendash}September) precipitation. Hydrologic changes for the entire water budget were estimated for both periods. In the pre-1948 period, a majority of the river basins experienced increased monsoon season precipitation, evapotranspiration (ET), and surface water availability (as defined by total runoff). Alternatively, in the post-1948 period, monsoon season precipitation declined in 11 of the 18 basins, with statistically significant trends in one (the Ganges basin), and most (15) basins experienced significant warming trends. Additionally, in the post-1948 period, the mean monsoon season ET and surface water availability declined in eight (with significant declines in four) basins. The results indicate that changes in ET and surface water availability in the pre- and post-1948 periods were largely driven by the changes in the monsoon season precipitation rather than air temperature, despite prominent warming after 1975. Coupled modes of variability of sea surface temperature (SST) and surface water availability indicated El Ni{\~n}o{\textendash}Southern Oscillation (ENSO) as the leading mode. The second mode was identified as the trend mode for surface water availability in the subcontinental river basins, which was largely driven by SST anomalies in the Indian and Atlantic Ocean regions. This indicates that surface water availability in India's subcontinental basins may be affected in the future in response to changes in large-scale climate variability.},

In addition, the current drought monitoring efforts do not consider groundwater storage variability. To overcome this, we develop an Integrated Drought Index (IDI) that combines the response of meteorological, hydrological, and agricultural droughts and accounts for groundwater storage. We use the Gaussian copula to integrate the 12-month Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), 4-month Standardized Runoff Index (SRI), 1-month Standardized Soil moisture Index (SSI), and 1-month Standardized Groundwater Index (SGI) to develop IDI. Hydrologic variables (total runoff, soil moisture, and groundwater) required in IDI were simulated using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) with SIMple Groundwater Model (VIC-SIMGM). We evaluated IDI against the Drought Severity Index (DSI), terrestrial and groundwater storage anomalies from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites, groundwater well, and streamflow anomalies. Moreover, we identify the three major droughts with the highest severity (based on IDI) that occurred in 1965, 1987, and 2002 in the Sabarmati river basin. The three most severe droughts occurred in 1966, 1979, and 2010 in the Brahmani basin.},

  abstract = {Global and regional trends in drought for 1950{\textendash}2000 are analyzed using a soil moisture{\textendash}based drought index over global terrestrial areas, excluding Greenland and Antarctica. The soil moisture fields are derived from a simulation of the terrestrial hydrologic cycle driven by a hybrid reanalysis{\textendash}observation forcing dataset. Drought is described in terms of various statistics that summarize drought duration, intensity, and severity. There is an overall small wetting trend in global soil moisture, forced by increasing precipitation, which is weighted by positive soil moisture trends over the Western Hemisphere and especially in North America. Regional variation is nevertheless apparent, and significant drying over West Africa, as driven by decreasing Sahel precipitation, stands out. Elsewhere, Europe appears to have not experienced significant changes in soil moisture, a trait shared by Southeast and southern Asia. Trends in drought duration, intensity, and severity are predominantly decreasing, but statistically significant changes are limited in areal extent, of the order of 1.0\%{\textendash}7.0\% globally, depending on the variable and drought threshold, and are generally less than 10\% of continental areas. Concurrent changes in drought spatial extent are evident, with a global decreasing trend of between Ϫ0.021\% and Ϫ0.035\% yrϪ1. Regionally, drought spatial extent over Africa has increased and is dominated by large increases over West Africa. Northern and East Asia show positive trends, and central Asia and the Tibetan Plateau show decreasing trends. In South Asia all trends are insignificant. Drought extent over Australia has decreased. Over the Americas, trends are uniformly negative and mostly significant.},

  abstract = {Daily streamflow information is critical for solving various hydrologic problems, though observations of continuous streamflow for model calibration are available at only a small fraction of the world's rivers. One approach to estimate daily streamflow at an ungauged location is to transfer rainfall{\textendash}runoff model parameters calibrated at a gauged (donor) catchment to an ungauged (receiver) catchment of interest. Central to this approach is the selection of a hydrologically similar donor. No single metric or set of metrics of hydrologic similarity have been demonstrated to consistently select a suitable donor catchment. We design an experiment to diagnose the dominant controls on successful hydrologic model parameter transfer. We calibrate a lumped rainfall{\textendash}runoff model to 83 stream gauges across the United States. All locations are USGS reference gauges with minimal human influence. Parameter sets from the calibrated models are then transferred to each of the other catchments and the performance of the transferred parameters is assessed. This transfer experiment is carried out both at the scale of the entire US and then for six geographic regions. We use classification and regression tree (CART) analysis to determine the relationship between catchment similarity and performance of transferred parameters. Similarity is defined using physical/climatic catchment characteristics, as well as streamflow response characteristics (signatures such as baseflow index and runoff ratio). Across the entire US, successful parameter transfer is governed by similarity in elevation and climate, and high similarity in streamflow signatures. Controls vary for different geographic regions though. Geology followed by drainage, topography and climate constitute the dominant similarity metrics in forested eastern mountains and plateaus, whereas agricultural land use relates most strongly with successful parameter transfer in the humid plains.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The alteration in river flow patterns, particularly those that originate in the Himalaya, has been caused by the increased temperature and rainfall variability brought on by climate change. Due to the impending intensification of extreme climate events, as predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its Sixth Assessment Report, it is more essential than ever to predict changes in streamflow for future periods. Despite the fact that some research has utilised machine-learning- and deep-learning-based models to predict streamflow patterns in response to climate change, very few studies have been undertaken for a mountainous catchment, with the number of studies for the western Himalaya being minimal. This study investigates the capability of five different machine learning (ML) models and one deep learning (DL) model, namely the Gaussian linear regression model (GLM), Gaussian generalised additive model (GAM), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARSs), artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF), and 1D convolutional neural network (1D-CNN), in streamflow prediction over the Sutlej River basin in the western Himalaya during the periods 2041{\textendash}2070 (2050s) and 2071{\textendash}2100 (2080s). Bias-corrected data downscaled at a grid resolution of 0.25{$\circ$}\,{\texttimes}\,0.25{$\circ$} from six general circulation models (GCMs) of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6~GCM framework under two greenhouse gas (GHG) trajectories (SSP245 and SSP585) were used for this purpose. Four different rainfall scenarios (R0, R1, R2, and R3) were applied to the models trained with daily data (1979{\textendash}2009) at Kasol (the outlet of the basin) in order to better understand how catchment size and the geo-hydromorphological aspects of the basin affect runoff. The predictive power of each model was assessed using six statistical measures, i.e. the coefficient of determination (R2), the ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of the measured data (RSR), the mean absolute error (MAE), the Kling{\textendash}Gupta efficiency (KGE), the Nash{\textendash}Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and the percent bias (PBIAS). The RF model with rainfall scenario R3, which outperformed other models during the training (R2\,=\,0.90; RSR\,=\,0.32; KGE\,=\,0.87; NSE\,=\,0.87; PBIAS\,=\,0.03) and testing (R2\,=\,0.78; RSR\,=\,0.47; KGE\,=\,0.82; NSE\,=\,0.71; PBIAS\,=\,-0.31) period, therefore was chosen to simulate streamflow in the Sutlej River in the 2050s and 2080s under the SSP245 and SSP585 scenarios. Bias correction was further applied to the projected daily streamflow in order to generate a reliable times series of the discharge. The mean ensemble of the model results shows that the mean annual streamflow of the Sutlej River is expected to rise between 2050s and 2080s by 0.79\,\% to 1.43\,\% for SSP585 and by 0.87\,\% to 1.10\,\% for SSP245. In addition, streamflow will increase during the monsoon (9.70\,\% to 11.41\,\% and 11.64\,\% to 12.70\,\%) in the 2050s and 2080s under both emission scenarios, but it will decrease during the pre-monsoon (-10.36\,\% to -6.12\,\% and -10.0\,\% to -9.13\,\%), post-monsoon (-1.23\,\% to -0.22\,\% and -5.59\,\% to -2.83\,\%), and during the winter (-21.87\,\% to -21.52\,\% and -21.87\,\% to -21.11\,\%). This variability in streamflow is highly correlated with the pattern of precipitation and temperature predicted by CMIP6~GCMs for future emission scenarios and with physical processes operating within the catchment. Predicted declines in the Sutlej River streamflow over the pre-monsoon (April to June) and winter (December to March) seasons might have a significant impact on agriculture downstream of the river, which is already having problems due to water restrictions at this time of year. The present study will therefore assist in strategy planning to ensure the sustainable use of water resources downstream by acquiring knowledge of the nature and causes of unpredictable streamflow patterns.},

The open-source programming language R has gained a central place in the hydrological sciences over the last decade, driven by the availability of diverse hydro-meteorological data archives and the development of open-source computational tools. The growth of R's usage in hydrology is reflected in the number of newly published hydrological packages, the strengthening of online user communities, and the popularity of training courses and events. In this paper, we explore the benefits and advantages of R's usage in hydrology, such as: the democratization of data science and numerical literacy, the enhancement of reproducible research and open science, the access to statistical tools, the ease of connecting R to and from other languages, and the support provided by a growing community. This paper provides an overview of important packages at every step of the hydrological workflow, from the retrieval of hydro-meteorological data, to spatial analysis and cartography, hydrological modelling, statistics, and the design of static and dynamic visualizations, presentations and documents. We discuss some of the challenges that arise when using R in hydrology and useful tools to overcome them, including the use of hydrological libraries, documentation and vignettes (long-form guides that illustrate how to use packages); the role of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs); and the challenges of Big Data and parallel computing in hydrology. Last, this paper provides a roadmap for R's future within hydrology, with R packages as a driver of progress in the hydrological sciences, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) providing new avenues for data acquisition and provision, enhanced teaching of hydrology in R, and the continued growth of the community via short courses and events.},

The discussion starts with the analysis of low-flow generating mechanisms operating in natural conditions and the description of anthropogenic factors which directly or indirectly affect low flows. This is followed by the review of existing methods of low-flow estimation from streamflow time-series, which include flow duration curves, frequency analysis of extreme low-flow events and continuous low-flow intervals, baseflow separation and characterisation of streamflow recessions. The paper describes the variety of low-flow characteristics (indices) and their applications. A separate section illustrates the relationships between low-flow characteristics. The paper further focuses on the techniques for low-flow estimation in ungauged river catchments, which include a regional regression approach, graphical representation of low-flow characteristics, construction of regional curves for low-flow prediction and application of time-series simulation methods. The paper presents a summary of recent international low-flow related research initiatives. Specific applications of low-flow data in river ecology studies and environmental flow management as well as the problem of changing minimum river flows as the result of climate variability are also discussed.

This study addresses whether the SPEI differs significantly from the SPI and tests its sensitivity to the choice of PET method by first comparing derived PET and then SPEI/SPI across 3950 gridded land cells in Europe using five commonly used PET methods with different complexity and input requirements. The SPEI was found to differ significantly from the SPI and the resulting PET and SPEI values found to group according to the PET radiation term. The mass transfer term, which integrates wind speed and humidity/pressure, was found to have a secondary effect on PET and no detectable effect on SPEI.},

  abstract = {To estimate the robustness of hydrologic models under projected future climate change, researchers test transferability between climatically contrasting observed periods. This approach can only assess the performance changes induced by altered precipitation and related environmental dynamics (e.g., greening under wet conditions), since the instrumental record does not contain temperatures or carbon dioxide levels that are similar to future climate change projections. Additionally, there is an inherent assumption that long-term persistence of changes in precipitation will not further impact catchment response. In this study, we undertake a series of virtual catchment experiments using an ecohydrologic model that simulates dynamic vegetation growth, nutrient cycling, and subsurface hydrology. These experiments explore a number of climate change scenarios. We compare simulations based on persistent altered climate states against simulations designed to represent historical periods with the same precipitation but limited time for ecohydrologic adaptation. We find that persistence of precipitation changes as well as increased temperature and elevated carbon dioxide levels can all substantially impact streamflow under drier future conditions. For wetter future scenarios, simulated differences in the flow regime were smaller, but there was still notable divergence in modeled low flows and other hydrologic variables. The results suggest that historical periods with equivalent precipitation statistics cannot necessarily be used as proxies for future climate change when examining catchment runoff response and/or model performance. The current literature likely underestimates the potential for nonstationarity in hydrologic assessments, especially for drier future scenarios. Plain Language Summary Climate change is expected to impact catchment processes in the future, altering hydrologic response. This raises the issue that models and methods developed using past data may not be reliable for simulating future conditions. To understand the extent of this problem, researchers often test models under climatically contrasting past periods. For example, if a model calibrated under wet conditions performs well simulating a dry period with 10\% less annual rainfall, we assume that the same model could reliably simulate a future climate with a 10\% reduction in rainfall. However, future climate change scenarios also have higher temperatures and carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, and the changes are expected to persist over many decades. Therefore, simulating contrasting past periods may cause less degradation in model performance than simulating future climate change. This study uses a detailed ecohydrologic model to run experiments analogous to a catchment under persistent climate change versus historical variability. We find that persistence of altered conditions, higher temperatures, and increased CO2 levels all influence catchment response substantially, meaning that climatically distinct past periods are not accurate proxies for future climate change. This suggests that testing model performance under past variability will underestimate the risk that climate change poses to hydrologic assessments.},

  abstract = {Rivers and river habitats around the world are under sustained pressure from human activities and the changing global environment. Our ability to quantify and manage the river states in a timely manner is critical for protecting the public safety and natural resources. In recent years, vector-based river network models have enabled modeling of large river basins at increasingly fine resolutions, but are computationally demanding. This work presents a multistage, physics-guided, graph neural network (GNN) approach for basin-scale river network learning and streamflow forecasting. During training, we train a GNN model to approximate outputs of a high-resolution vector-based river network model; we then fine-tune the pretrained GNN model with streamflow observations. We further apply a graph-based, data-fusion step to correct prediction biases. The GNN-based framework is first demonstrated over a snow-dominated watershed in the western United States. A series of experiments are performed to test different training and imputation strategies. Results show that the trained GNN model can effectively serve as a surrogate of the process-based model with high accuracy, with median Kling{\textendash}Gupta efficiency (KGE) greater than 0.97. Application of the graph-based data fusion further reduces mismatch between the GNN model and observations, with as much as 50 \% KGE improvement over some cross-validation gages. To improve scalability, a graph-coarsening procedure is introduced and is demonstrated over a much larger basin. Results show that graph coarsening achieves comparable prediction skills at only a fraction of training cost, thus providing important insights into the degree of physical realism needed for developing large-scale GNN-based river network models.},

The most commonly used methods are based on the proximity of catchment centroids and physiographic and/or climatic conditions of the catchments. However, the proximity of the catchment centroids and catchment physical attributes do not necessarily translate into similarities in hydrologic behavior. It is also difficult to identify the key attributes that favor hydrologic similarity. Therefore, in this study, we proposed a new method called catchment runoff-response similarity (CRRS), in the view of reducing the hydrologic process predictive uncertainty and to solve the problem of the key attributes identification that favor hydrologic similarity. The CRRS has a two-step approach: 1) the commonly used regionalization approach is used to temporarily transpose the calibrated model parameter from gauged to ungauged catchments, and 2) the runoff response of each smaller delineated subbasin of the gauged and ungauged basins are obtained based on the parameter value computed in the first step. The similar subbasins of the gauged and ungauged basins are then identified based on their runoff response similarity. The final parameter value in the ungauged subbasins are determined based on the notion that similar subbasins with runoff responses to similar input rainfall could have similar model structure settings.},

Due to a limited amount of published studies on genuinely ungauged basins, model validation and realism assessment of model outcome has not been discussed to a great extent. With this paper we aim to contribute to the discussion on how one can determine the value and validity of a hydrological model developed for an ungauged basin. As in many cases no local, or even regional, data are available, alternative methods should be applied. Using a PUB case study in a genuinely ungauged basin in southern Cambodia, we give several examples of how one can use different types of soft data to improve model design, calibrate and validate the model, and assess the realism of the model output. A rainfall-runoff model was coupled to an irrigation reservoir, allowing the use of additional and unconventional data. The model was mainly forced with remote sensing data, and local knowledge was used to constrain the parameters. Model realism assessment was done using data from surveys. This resulted in a successful reconstruction of the reservoir dynamics, and revealed the different hydrological characteristics of the two topographical classes. This paper does not present a generic approach that can be transferred to other ungauged catchments, but it aims to show how clever model design and alternative data acquisition can result in a valuable hydrological model for an ungauged catchment.},

  abstract = {Impacts of a drought are generally dependent on the severity of the hydrological drought event, which can be expressed by streamflow drought duration or deficit volume. For prediction and the selection of drought sensitive regions, it is crucial to know how streamflow drought severity relates to climate and catchment characteristics. In this study we investigated controls on drought severity based on a comprehensive Austrian dataset consisting of 44 catchments with long time series of hydrometeorological data (on average around 50 year) and information on a large number of physiographic catchment characteristics. Drought analysis was performed with the variable threshold level method and various statistical tools were applied, i.e. bivariate correlation analysis, heatmaps, linear models based on multiple regression, varying slope models, and automatic stepwise regression. Results indicate that streamflow drought duration is primarily controlled by storage, quantified by the Base Flow Index or by a combination of catchment characteristics related to catchment storage and release, e.g. geology and land use. Additionally, the duration of dry spells in precipitation is important for streamflow drought duration. Hydrological drought deficit, however, is governed by average catchment wetness (represented by mean annual precipitation) and elevation (reflecting seasonal storage in the snow pack and glaciers). Our conclusion is that both drought duration and deficit are governed by a combination of climate and catchment control, but not in a similar way. Besides meteorological forcing, storage is important; storage in soils, aquifers, lakes, etc. influences drought duration and seasonal storage in snow and glaciers influences drought deficit. Consequently, the spatial variation of hydrological drought severity is highly dependent on terrestrial hydrological processes.},

We use the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) with reservoir operations (VIC-Res) scheme to simulate the daily river flow at four locations in the Narmada Basin. Streamflow prediction skills of the ERFS forecast were examined for the period 2003{\textendash}2018 at 1{\textendash}32 d lead. We compared the streamflow forecast skills of raw meteorological forecasts from ERFS and GEFS at a 1{\textendash}10 d lead for the summer monsoon (June{\textendash}September) 2019{\textendash}2020. The ERFS forecast underestimates extreme precipitation against the observations compared to the GEFS forecast during the summer monsoon of 2019{\textendash}2020. However, both forecast products show better skills for minimum and maximum temperatures than precipitation. Ensemble streamflow forecast from the GEFS performs better than the ERFS during 2019{\textendash}2020. The performance of GEFS-based ensemble streamflow forecast declines after 5 days lead. Overall, the GEFS ensemble streamflow forecast can provide reliable skills at a 1{\textendash}5 d lead, which can be utilized in streamflow prediction. Our findings provide directions for developing a flood early warning system based on ensemble streamflow prediction considering the influence of reservoirs in India.},

Mathematically, the SPEI is similar to the standardized precipitation index (SPI), but it includes the role of temperature. Because the SPEI is based on a water balance, it can be compared to the self-calibrated Palmer drought severity index (sc-PDSI). Time series of the three indices were compared for a set of observatories with different climate characteristics, located in different parts of the world. Under global warming conditions, only the sc-PDSI and SPEI identified an increase in drought severity associated with higher water demand as a result of evapotranspiration. Relative to the sc-PDSI, the SPEI has the advantage of being multiscalar, which is crucial for drought analysis and monitoring.},

For this purpose, they compare the performance of several drought indices [the standardized precipitation index (SPI); four versions of the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI); and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI)] to predict changes in streamflow, soil moisture, forest growth, and crop yield. The authors found a superior capability of the SPEI and the SPI drought indices, which are calculated on different time scales than the Palmer indices to capture the drought impacts on the aforementioned hydrological, agricultural, and ecological variables. They detected small differences in the comparative performance of the SPI and the SPEI indices, but the SPEI was the drought index that best captured the responses of the assessed variables to drought in summer, the season in which more drought-related impacts are recorded and in which drought monitoring is critical. Hence, the SPEI shows improved capability to identify drought impacts as compared with the SPI.

  abstract = {Flooding is the most catastrophic, wide spread, and frequent natural hazards causing extensive damages on infrastructure, human life, and the environment. The frequency and severity of flooding has been increasing all over the world attributed to climate change and escalated urbanization. As such, the issue and techniques of monitoring and mapping flood inundated areas are also increasing. Advancement of state-of-the-art technologies have facilitated and improved flood mapping and monitoring. Earth observation plays important role in flood mapping, monitoring, and damage assessment. However, there are fundamental issues that restricts satellite data from being used for flood studies. LiDAR DEM data based flood modeling approach solves some of the limitations of Earth observation. On the other hand, flood modeling using LiDAR DEM data are challenging. The aim of this review is, therefore, to identify the opportunities and challenges of using LIDAR DEM data for flood mapping and assessment. Substantial literature review was done to attain the stated objective. The study revealed that flood modeling techniques could significantly improve the limitations of detecting flood using Earth observation such as detecting flooded areas under dense canopies and in urban areas. This is attributed to the accurate and fine resolution LiDAR DEM. Furthermore, LiDAR technology provide several opportunities such as relatively cost and time effective data collection system, capability of penetrating dense vegetation, and improved flood model accuracy and fine scale flood modeling. On the other hand, LiDAR data filtering (classification), data availability and accessibility, data file size, high computational time, inability to characterize channels bathymetry, and insufficiency of representing complex urban features are some of the challenges. Therefore, multi-platform LiDAR data (i.e., ground-based, airborne and space borne) and data from additional sources such as echo soundings and electronic theodolite surveys should be integrated to increase the effectiveness of the LiDAR technology for flood modeling.},

  abstract = {Leaf area index (LAI) is a key biophysical variable in most process-based forest-ecosystem models. However, most such models require LAI as an input, typically obtained from empirical observations. We tested whether scaling principles based on trade-offs between single leaf and canopy properties could be effectively used to model LAI, thereby obviating the need for empirical observations. To do so, we used the process-oriented model, PnET, configured to estimate LAI from these same scaling principles. We derived biologically based LAI predictions (LAIPnET) for the Harvard Forest (Massachusetts, USA) eddy covariance tower site, a predominately mixed deciduous hardwood forest, using PnET, and compared these with a locally observed phenology record and with LAI estimates from both local (ground-based) photosynthetically active radiation transmittance (LAITRANS) and normalized difference vegetation index satellite data (LAINDVI). We generated the LAIPnET trajectory by running the PnET model with meteorological observations from the flux tower as model drivers. We derived LAITRANS from measurements of above- and below-canopy photosynthetically active radiation at the flux tower, and LAINDVI from observations from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite-borne sensor of surface greenness for the 1 km2 cell containing the flux tower. Over a 5-year period, LAIPnET and LAITRANS values were comparable intra- and interannually, with maximum values differing by less than 0.1 to 0.2 LAI units (m2 m{\textendash}2). Values of LAINDVI were similar to LAIPnET and LAITRANS in midsummer, but higher LAI values were predicted in the early and late portions of the growing season.},

The use of conceptual models to explore the impact of climate changes has increased in recent years. Because of the success claimed for these studies, it is likely that computer simulation of catchments will increasingly be used by and for water resource managers as an aid to decision-making. There is therefore a need for a generally accepted method for demonstrating a model's {\textregistered}tness for such use. The simple split-sample test method may be reasonable in the simplest case of the `{\textregistered}lling-in missing data' problem but certainly not if the express purpose of the model is to simulate records for conditions different from those corresponding to the calibration record, such as the problem with predicting the effects of climate changes where the data on the changed system are not (and cannot be) available for comparison with the model predictions. Thus, model validation must demonstrate `{\textregistered}tness for the said purpose'.},

Using the Wei River basin as a case study, we assessed the runoff reduction influenced by climate change and human activities from 1970 to 2017. The results show that human activities are the primary driver for runoff reduction. The highest contribution of human activities was estimated by the DMC (93.2\%{\textendash}99.9\%), followed by MDMC and SWAT (65.6\%{\textendash}87.1\%), while the Budyko-based had the smallest estimates (55.3\%{\textendash}61.2\%).

Linear boundaries have been widely used to define the rules. However, urban land use dynamics and many other geographical phenomena are highly complex and require nonlinear boundaries for the rules. In this study, we tested the support vector machines (SVM) as a method for constructing nonlinear transition rules for CA. SVM is good at dealing with nonlinear complex relationships. Its basic idea is to project input vectors to a higher dimensional Hilbert feature space, in which an optimal classifying hyperplane can be constructed through structural risk minimization and margin maximization. The optimal hyperplane is unique and its optimality is global. The proposed SVM-CA model was implemented using Visual Basic, ArcObjectss, and OSU-SVM. A case study simulating the urban development in the Shenzhen City, China demonstrates that the proposed model can achieve high accuracy and overcome some limitations of existing CA models in simulating complex urban systems.},

The access to daily stream flow data within ungauged catchments is also a central component of many aspects of water resource and water quality management.This paper explores the problem of regionalisation a rainfall-runoff model within the United Kingdom for water resources applications. The results from a regionalisation study using a large dataset of 260 catchments within the United Kingdom are presented.Two approaches to the regionalisation approach are developed and evaluated; a regression-based approach relating model parameters to catchment characteristics and a nearest neighbour based approach. The value of both approaches is evaluated in the context of the quality of the simulations obtained with regionalised parameter sets. The paper identifies that the regression-based approach yields the best predictive results and that these results are encouraging in the context of operational water management. However, the ultimate limitations of the approach are recognised and recommendations are made for further research on nearest neighbour approaches. The paper concludes by raising the question whether the regionalisation of the parameters for prior calibrated model is the most appropriate way to approach the regionalisation question and suggests an alternative modelling framework based on hydrological response units.},

A new drought index, standardized supply-demand water index (SSDI), has been proposed in this research. The SSDI describes drought from the view of water supply-demand relations using a simple water balance model. It was used to assess historical drought events in the middle and lower Jinsha river basin (MLJRB) located in the southwest China and applied to address the drought conditions in the MLJRB under current and future climates. The results showed the following: (1) The average drought area during 2001 to 2011 reached up to 9.9 {\texttimes} 10               3               \,km               2               , accounting for 35.4\% of the whole farmland area in the MLJRB, which was about twice as the drought area during 1961 to 2000. The region for greater drought severity with more drought events and longer duration was mainly distributed in Dali, Chuxiong, Kunming, and Yuxi. (2) For the period 2021 to 2050, total drought area was projected to increase by 43.2\%. The drought-prone regions could move further towards the northwest of the MLJRB.},

  abstract = {Drought is a stochastic natural hazard that is instigated by intense and persistent shortage of precipitation. Following an initial meteorological phenomenon, subsequent impacts are realized on agriculture and hydrology. Among the natural hazards, droughts possess certain unique features; in addition to delayed effects, droughts vary by multiple dynamic dimensions including severity and duration, which in addition to causing a pervasive and subjective network of impacts makes them difficult to characterize. In order manage drought, drought characterization is essential enabling both retrospective analyses (e.g., severity versus impacts analysis) and prospective planning (e.g., risk assessment). The adaptation of a simplified method by drought indices has facilitated drought characterization for various users and entities. More than 100 drought indices have so far been proposed, some of which are operationally used to characterize drought using gridded maps at regional and national levels. These indices correspond to different types of drought, including meteorological, agricultural, and hydrological drought. By quantifying severity levels and declaring drought's start and end, drought indices currently aid in a variety of operations including drought early warning and monitoring and contingency planning. Given their variety and ongoing development, it is crucial to provide a comprehensive overview of available drought indices that highlights their difference and examines the trend in their development. This paper reviews 74 operational and proposed drought indices and describes research directions.

  abstract = {The summer monsoon transition zone (SMTZ) in China represents an unusual land type with an agro-pasture ecotone, and it is a climate-sensitive region. Changes in climate aridity and changes in meteorological drought are mutually related yet fundamentally different. In this study, potential evapotranspiration (ETO) is calculated using Penman{\textendash}Monteith, based on China's national meteorological stations data from 1961 to 2013. An ETO-based climate aridity index (IAI) and ETObased standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) are used as the metrics for climate aridity and meteorological drought, respectively. The result shows a significant difference between climate aridity and meteorological drought in the SMTZ, compared with the monsoon and nonmonsoon zone. This difference varies on different time scales (1{\textendash}48 months), and the greatest differences between IAI and SPEI are on seasonal and monthly scales (1{\textendash}12 months), but lower at longer time scales ({$>$}12 months). The first reason for the difference is the desynchronicity of meteorological drought and the background climate. After the background climate becomes a relatively arid state (such as 0.96 {$<$} IAI {$<$} 1) from a semi-arid state (0.50 {$<$} IAI {$<$} 0.80), the continued arid state with weak IAI fluctuations eventually results in increasingly severe meteorological droughts, or the recurrence of equally severe droughts with drastic reduction. Consequently, the onset of the most severe climate aridity is two to seven months (mostly three to four months) ahead of the onset of the most severe drought events, until the climate returns to a semi-arid state. Second, climate aridity represents the average state of the background climate over a long time period and changes gently, while meteorological droughts are stochastic climate events and change drastically. These findings indicate that IAI can serve as a predictor of the onset of meteorological drought events, especially in the SMTZ, but it fails to characterize the progression of meteorological drought events well. Therefore, this result is of great significance for drought prediction and early warning.},
