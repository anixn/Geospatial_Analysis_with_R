## What is Geo-spatial analysis

A multidisciplinary approach involving patterns identification, relationships, and trends within geographic data. It integrates concepts from geography, cartography, geographic information systems (GIS), and statistical analysis to gain insights into spatial phenomena. 

_Key components of geo-spatial analysis include:_

--
- **Geographic Information Systems (GIS):** GIS is a technology that enables the capture, storage, analysis, and visualization of spatial data.

--
- **Remote Sensing:** Remote sensing involves acquiring information about the Earth's surface without direct physical contact.

--
- **Spatial Statistics:** This involves the application of statistical techniques to analyze spatial patterns and relationships.

--
- **Spatial Modeling:** This involves creating mathematical representations of spatial relationships to simulate and predict real-world phenomena.

## The shift towards open geospatial:
Open source refers to software that is designed to be publicly accessible, allowing anyone to see, modify, and distribute the code as they see fit.

.pull-left[
- Open Data applies the principles of free and open to geo-spatial data.

- Open Education applies the principles of open source to the creation of teaching materials allowing organizations to share syllabus materials reducing cost and reaching a wider audience.

- Open Standards promote inter-operability between applications. 

- Open standard are a key tool allowing geo-spatial practitioners to work together, with the added benefit of avoiding **technology lock-in**.

## Why to use open sourced tools/software
.f3[
- **Free to use:** Open-source software is often available at no cost, saving you money on licensing fees.
- **Community support:** You can benefit from a large community of users and developers who provide support, resources, and updates.
- **Customization:** Open-source software allows you to modify and adapt the code to fit your specific needs and preferences.
- **Interoperability:** It seamlessly integrates with other software and systems, promoting compatibility and collaboration.
- **Transparency:** The code is openly accessible, ensuring transparency and trust in the software's functionality and security.

# Basic data type in GIS

1. Raster data consists of continuous cells or pixels, such as elevation or satellite imagery.


--
2. Attribute data describes the characteristics or properties of spatial features, such as name, population, area, etc. 
>  - For example, a polygon layer of countries may have an attribute table that contains information about each country‚Äôs name, capital, GDP, etc.


--
<br /> 
.co-note[
GeoPackage (GPKG) is an open, non-proprietary, platform-independent and standards-based data format for geographic information systems. <br /> 

- It is built as a set of conventions over a SQLite database. <br /> 

- GeoPackage is an open, standards-based, platform-independent, portable, self-describing, compact format for transferring geospatial information. <br />
