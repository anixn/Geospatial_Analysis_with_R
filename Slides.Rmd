## What do we understand from "Geospatial Analysis"?

A multidisciplinary approach involving patterns identification, relationships, and trends within geographic data. 

- Concepts from geography, cartography, geographic information systems (GIS), and statistical analysis to gain insights into spatial phenomena. 

.f3[Key components of geo-spatial analysis include:]

--
- **Geographic Information Systems (GIS):** GIS is a technology that enables the capture, storage, analysis, and visualization of spatial data.

--
- **Remote Sensing:** Remote sensing involves acquiring information about the Earth's surface without direct physical contact.

--
- **Spatial Statistics:** This involves the application of statistical techniques to analyze spatial patterns and relationships.

--
- **Spatial Modeling:** This involves creating mathematical representations of spatial relationships to simulate and predict real-world phenomena.

## What is Scripting?

.pull-left[
- Scripting refers to writing a series of instructions or commands that can be executed by a computer. 

- These instructions are written in a programming language (R, Python, SQL)

- We use R programming language for this. 

- R is scripting language specifically designed for statistical computing and graphics. ]

## Why use scripting
.pull-left[
- **Control:** With scripting, you have precise control over every step of the analysis process. 
- **Efficiency:** Scripting allows for automation of repetitive tasks, saving time and effort compared to manually clicking through GUI interfaces.

- **Speed:** Scripting allows for faster execution of repetitive tasks compared to navigating through multiple GUI menus. 

- **Customization:** Scripting offers greater flexibility in tailoring analyses to your specific needs. 

- **Reproducibility:** This is crucial for transparency, peer review, and building upon existing research.


- **Scalability:** Efficient scripts can handle large datasets more efficiently than GUI-based tools.

## The shift towards open geospatial:
Open source refers to software that is designed to be publicly accessible, allowing anyone to see, modify, and distribute the code as they see fit.

.pull-left[
- Open Data applies the principles of free and open to geo-spatial data.

- Open Education applies the principles of open source to the creation of teaching materials allowing organizations to share syllabus materials reducing cost and reaching a wider audience.

- Open Standards promote inter-operability between applications. 

- Open standard are a key tool allowing geo-spatial practitioners to work together, with the added benefit of avoiding **technology lock-in**.

## Why to use open sourced tools/software
.f3[
- **Free to use:** Open-source software is often available at no cost, saving you money on licensing fees.
- **Community support:** You can benefit from a large community of users and developers who provide support, resources, and updates.
- **Customization:** Open-source software allows you to modify and adapt the code to fit your specific needs and preferences.
- **Interoperability:** It seamlessly integrates with other software and systems, promoting compatibility and collaboration.
- **Transparency:** The code is openly accessible, ensuring transparency and trust in the software's functionality and security.

# Basic data type in GIS
- **Raster data** consists of continuous cells or pixels, such as elevation or satellite imagery.

--
- **Vector data** is the most common type of GIS data. Vector data represents geographic data symbolized as points, lines, or polygons.

--

- **GeoPackage (GPKG)** is an open, non-proprietary, platform-independent and standards-based data format for geographic information systems. 
  - GeoPackage can store multiple types of geospatial data, including vector data, raster data, and attribute data.
  - Portability: GeoPackage is a single file format that can be easily transferred between different devices, operating systems, and GIS software.

## R package for Geospatial analysis

--
- **terra:** Spatial Data Analysis - Offers advanced raster data handling capabilities, including large dataset support and high-performance computation. 

--
- **raster:** Raster Data Analysis - Offers functions for working with gridded spatial data

--
- **sf:** Simple Features for R - A comprehensive package for working with spatial data using modern data structures and methods.

--
- **stars:** Spatiotemporal Arrays - Provides a unified framework for handling spatiotemporal raster data, allowing for efficient analysis and visualization.

--
- **rgdal:** Bindings for the 'Geospatial' Data Abstraction Library

--
- **leaflet:** Interactive Web Maps with the JavaScript 'Leaflet' Library
spatial: Functions for Kriging and Point Pattern Analysis - Implements various spatial statistical methods.

--
- **tmap:** Thematic Maps - Provides a flexible framework for creating thematic maps. <br />

--
etc...

## `terra`: for spatial data analysis

> This package is an attempt to climb on the shoulders of giants (GDAL, PROJ, GEOS, NCDF, GeographicLib, Rcpp, R).

- `terra` provides methods to manipulate geographic (spatial) data in "raster" and "vector" form.

- **Vector** spatial data (points, lines, polygons) are typically used to represent discrete spatial entities, such as a road, country, or bus stop

## Basics of R-Programming
.note[
- It‚Äôs open-source. No fees or licenses are needed.
- It‚Äôs platform-independent.
- It has lots of packages. 
- It‚Äôs great for statistics. 
- It‚Äôs well suited for Machine Learning. 
- R lets you perform data wrangling. 
- R is still growing.

## Vegetation indices
Let‚Äôs define a general function for a ratio based (vegetation) index. In the function below, img is a muti-layer SpatRaster object and i and k are the indices of the layers (layer numbers) used to compute the vegetation index.

```{r}
vi <- function(img, k, i) {
    bk <- img[[k]]
    bi <- img[[i]]
    vi <- (bk - bi) / (bk + bi)
    return(vi)
}
```
    
    
###  For Landsat NIR = 5, red = 4.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
ndvi <- vi(landsat, 5, 4)
plot(ndvi, col=rev(terrain.colors(10)), main = "NDVI")
plot(ndvi, col=rev(rainbow(10)), main="Landsat-NDVI")


GNDVI <- vi(landsat, 5, 3)
```
